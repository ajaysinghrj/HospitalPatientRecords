# 🏥 Hospital Patient Records Management System  
**Mini Project - Java | JDBC | SQLite | Swing GUI**

---

## 📘 Overview  
The **Hospital Patient Records Management System** is a **Java-based desktop application** that efficiently manages patient data, hospital records, and database operations.  
This project demonstrates how **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **Java Swing**, and **JDBC** integration can be combined to create a structured and interactive system for real-world healthcare data management.

The system allows hospital staff to:
- Add, view, and manage patient records  
- Store data securely in an SQLite database  
- Perform automatic backups using multithreading  
- Handle errors gracefully through custom exception classes  

It provides a **user-friendly interface** while maintaining robust backend performance and data consistency.
